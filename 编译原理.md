A compiler is often made up of several components, one of which is a parser. A common set of components in a compiler is:

 * Lexer - break the program up into words.
 * Parser - check that the syntax of the sentences are correct.
 * Semantic Analysis - check that the sentences make sense.
 * Optimizer - edit the sentences for brevity.
 * Code generator - output something with equivalent semantic meaning using another vocabulary.
 
The Interpreter is usually a program that will run a code without the need to compile it, a compiler is a program that willcompile the code into another program in order to run it. The parser is both used by the compiler and interpreter in orderto verify the correct syntax used in the code (i.e determines errors in the code stoping it from compiling or interpreting)
