### Atom plugin

linter-eslint will look for a version of eslint local to your project and use it if it's available. If none is found it will fall back to the version it ships with.

Lets say you depend on a specific version of eslint, maybe it has unreleased features, maybe it's just newer than what linter-eslint ships with. If `your-project/node_modules/eslint` exists linter-eslint will be used. This package requires an eslint of at least v1.0.0.

Note that if you do not have the linter package installed it will be installed for you. If you are using an alternative linter-* consumer feel free to disable the linter package.

- Use with plugins
	You have two options:

* Install locally to your project eslint and the plugin

	`$ npm i --save-dev eslint [eslint-plugins]``
* Install globally eslint and plugins

	`$ npm i -g eslint [eslint-plugins]`
	Activate Use Global Eslint package option
	(Optional) Set Global Node Path with $ npm config get prefix

- Using ESLint
	Note that recent versions of ESLint do not use any rules by-default. This means you have to specify a configuration file for your project!
	To do this in a straightforward way run this:
	`eslint --init`
	Alternatively you can create the .eslintrc file by yourself. It is a good idea to have a look at the Get Started With ESLint blog post by IanVS and the ESLint documentation, including the list of rules.

- Installation and Usage 

There are two ways to install ESLint: globally and locally.

1. Local Installation and Usage

If you want to include ESLint as part of your project's build system, we recommend installing it locally. You can do so using npm:

`$ npm install eslint --save-dev`

You should then setup a configuration file:
`$ ./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init`

After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this:
`$ ./node_modules/.bin/eslint yourfile.js`

Any plugins or shareable configs that you use must also be installed locally to work with a locally-installed ESLint.

2. Global Installation and Usage

If you want to make ESLint available to tools that run across all of your projects, we recommend installing ESLint globally. You can do so using npm:
`$ npm install -g eslint`

You should then setup a configuration file:
`$ eslint --init`

After that, you can run ESLint on any file or directory like this:
`$ eslint yourfile.js`

Any plugins or shareable configs that you use must also be installed globally to work with a globally-installed ESLint.

Note: `eslint --init` is intended for setting up and configuring ESLint on a per-project basis and will perform a local installation of ESLint and its plugins in the directory in which it is run. If you prefer using a global installation of ESLint, any plugins used in your configuration must also be installed globally.

- Configuration

After running `eslint --init`, you'll have a `.eslintrc` file in your directory. In it, you'll see some rules configured like this:
```js
{
    "rules": {
        "semi": ["error", "always"],
        "quotes": ["error", "double"]
    }
}
```
The names "semi" and "quotes" are the names of rules in ESLint. The first value is the error level of the rule and can be one of these values:

`"off"` or `0` - turn the rule off
`"warn"` or `1` - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn't affect exit code)
`"error"` or `2` - turn the rule on as an error (exit code will be 1)
The three error levels allow you fine-grained control over how ESLint applies rules (for more configuration options and details, see the configuration docs).

 We recommend using `eslint-plugin-react` if you are using React and want React semantics.
		
### Specifying Parcer Options 		
 Here’s an example `.eslintrc.json` file:
```js
 {
     "parserOptions": {
         "ecmaVersion": 6,
         "sourceType": "module",
         "ecmaFeatures": {
             "jsx": true
         }
     },
     "rules": {
         "semi": 2
     }
 }
```	

### Specifying Parser 
By default, ESLint uses Espree as its parser. You can optionally specify that a different parser should be used in your configuration file so long as the parser meets the following requirements:

	It must be an npm module installed locally.
	It must have an Esprima-compatible interface (it must export a parse() method).
	It must produce Esprima-compatible AST and token objects.
	
Note that even with these compatibilities, there are no guarantees that an external parser will work correctly with ESLint and ESLint will not fix bugs related to incompatibilities with other parsers.

To indicate the npm module to use as your parser, specify it using the parser option in your .eslintrc file. For example, the following specifies to use Esprima instead of Espree:

{
    "parser": "babel-eslint",
    "rules": {
        "semi": "error"
    }
}

The following parsers are compatible with ESLint:

Esprima
Babel-ESLint - A wrapper around the Babel parser that makes it compatible with ESLint.
Note when using a custom parser, the parserOptions configuration property is still required for ESLint to work properly with features not in ECMAScript 5 by default. Parsers are all passed parserOptions and may or may not use them to determine which features to enable.
		
### Specifying Environments
An environment defines global variables that are predefined. The available environments are:

`browser` - browser global variables.
`node` - Node.js global variables and Node.js scoping.
`commonjs` - CommonJS global variables and CommonJS scoping (use this for browser-only code that uses Browserify/WebPack).
`es6` - enable all ECMAScript 6 features except for modules (this automatically sets the ecmaVersion parser option to 6).
`mocha` - adds all of the Mocha testing global variables.
`jquery` - jQuery global variables.
`mongo` - MongoDB global variables.

Environments can be specified inside of a file, in configuration files or using the --env command line flag.

To specify environments using a comment inside of your JavaScript file, use the following format:

`/* eslint-env node, mocha */`

To specify environments in a configuration file, use the env key and specify which environments you want to enable by setting each to true. For example, the following enables the browser and Node.js environments:

```js
{
    "env": {
        "browser": true,
        "node": true
    }
}
```


### Specifying Globals
To specify globals using a comment inside of your JavaScript file, use the following format:
`/* global var1, var2 */`
This defines two global variables, var1 and var2. If you want to optionally specify that these global variables should never be written to (only read), then you can set each with a false flag:
`/* global var1:false, var2:false */`

To configure global variables inside of a configuration file, use the globals key and indicate the global variables you want to use. Set each global variable name equal to true to allow the variable to be overwritten or false to disallow overwriting. For example:
```js
{
    "globals": {
        "var1": true,
        "var2": false
    }
}
```

### Configuring Plugins
ESLint supports the use of third-party plugins. Before using the plugin you have to install it using npm.

To configure plugins inside of a configuration file, use the plugins key, which contains a list of plugin names. The eslint-plugin- prefix can be omitted from the plugin name.

```js
{
    "plugins": [
        "plugin1",
        "eslint-plugin-plugin2"
    ]
}
```

### Configuring Rules

ESLint comes with a large number of rules. You can modify which rules your project uses either using configuration comments or configuration files. To change a rule setting, you must set the rule ID equal to one of these values:

"off" or 0 - turn the rule off
"warn" or 1 - turn the rule on as a warning (doesn’t affect exit code)
"error" or 2 - turn the rule on as an error (exit code is 1 when triggered)
To configure rules inside of a file using configuration comments, use a comment in the following format:

`/* eslint eqeqeq: "off", curly: "error" */`
		
To configure rules inside of a configuration file, use the rules key along with an error level and any options you want to use. For example:		
		
```js
{
    "rules": {
        "eqeqeq": "off",
        "curly": "error",
        "quotes": ["error", "double"],
				"plugin1/rule1": "error" // rule defined within a plugin 
    }
}
```

### Disabling Rules with Inline Comments

To temporarily disable rule warnings in your file, use block comments in the following format:

```js
/* eslint-disable */
alert('foo');
/* eslint-enable */
```

You can also disable or enable warnings for specific rules:

```js
/* eslint-disable no-alert, no-console */
alert('foo');
console.log('bar');
/* eslint-enable no-alert, no-console */
```

To disable rule warnings in an entire file, put a `/* eslint-disable */` block comment at the top of the file:

```js
/* eslint-disable */
alert('foo');
```

You can also disable or enable specific rules for an entire file:

```js
/* eslint-disable no-alert */
alert('foo');		
```
		
### Using Configuration Files

To use configuration files is via `.eslintrc.*` and `package.json` files. ESLint will automatically look for them in the directory of the file to be linted, and in successive parent directories all the way up to the root directory of the filesystem. This option is useful when you want different configurations for different parts of a project or when you want others to be able to use ESLint directly without needing to remember to pass in the configuration file.

In each case, the settings in the configuration file override default settings

#### Configuration File Formats
ESLint supports configuration files in several formats:

- JavaScript - use `.eslintrc.js` and export an object containing your configuration.
- YAML - use `.eslintrc.yaml` or `.eslintrc.yml` to define the configuration structure.
- JSON - use `.eslintrc.json` to define the configuration structure. ESLint’s JSON files also allow JavaScript-style comments.
- Deprecated - use `.eslintrc`, which can be either JSON or YAML.
- package.json - create an `eslintConfig` property in your `package.json` file and define your configuration there.

If there are multiple configuration files in the same directory, ESLint will only use one. The priority order is:

1 .eslintrc.js
2 .eslintrc.yaml
3 .eslintrc.yml
4 .eslintrc.json
5 .eslintrc
6 package.json

### Configuration Cascading and Hierarchy  

When using .eslintrc.* and package.json files for configuration, you can take advantage of configuration cascading. For instance, suppose you have the following structure:

your-project
├── .eslintrc
├── lib
│ └── source.js
└─┬ tests
  ├── .eslintrc
  └── test.js
	
The configuration cascade works by using the closest .eslintrc file to the file being linted as the highest priority, then any configuration files in the parent directory, and so on. When you run ESLint on this project, all files in lib/ will use the .eslintrc file at the root of the project as their configuration. When ESLint traverses into the tests/ directory, it will then use your-project/tests/.eslintrc in addition to your-project/.eslintrc. So your-project/tests/test.js is linted based on the combination of the two .eslintrc files in its directory hierarchy, with the closest one taking priority. In this way, you can have project-level ESLint settings and also have directory-specific overrides


If there is an .eslintrc and a package.json file found in the same directory, .eslintrc will take a priority and package.json file will not be used.

Note: If you have a personal configuration file in your home directory (~/.eslintrc), it will only be used if no other configuration files are found. Since a personal configuration would apply to everything inside of a user’s directory, including third-party code, this could cause problems when running ESLint.

By default, ESLint will look for configuration files in all parent folders up to the root directory. This can be useful if you want all of your projects to follow a certain convention, but can sometimes lead to unexpected results. To limit ESLint to a specific project, place "root": true inside the eslintConfig field of the package.json file or in the .eslintrc.* file at your project’s root level. ESLint will stop looking in parent folders once it finds a configuration with "root": true.
```js
{
    "root": true
}
```
